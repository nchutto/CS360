 CS 360 – Mobile Application Development

Nicole Hutto

 Project Overview

This repository contains my coursework and final project for CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming.

For this course, I developed a Weight Tracker Android Application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to:

Create an account

Log in securely

Add weight entries

Assign dates to entries

Delete entries

View progress in a structured list format

Navigate between screens using Jetpack Navigation

This project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and troubleshoot a fully functional Android application from start to finish.

 Technologies Used

Kotlin

Jetpack Compose

Material3

Navigation Component

Android Runtime Permissions

Android Studio

Key Concepts Demonstrated

Multi-screen app architecture

Navigation with NavController

State management using remember and mutableStateOf

User input validation

Runtime permission handling

UI design using composable functions

Debugging with Logcat

 Application Features
 Authentication Screens

Login screen

Registration screen

Password field security using PasswordVisualTransformation

 Weight Tracking

Add weight entries

Assign a date to each entry

Display entries in a LazyColumn

Delete entries dynamically

Real-time state updates

 Permissions Handling

SMS permission request (if applicable to assignment requirements)

Runtime permission launcher integration

 Challenges & Solutions

Throughout development, I encountered issues related to:

Navigation route mismatches

App crashes due to composable state errors

Permission handling logic

UI layout inconsistencies

These were resolved by:

Reviewing Logcat error messages

Incremental feature testing

Cleaning and rebuilding the project

Refining composable structure

 Skills Gained

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:

Android app architecture

Kotlin programming

UI design with Compose

Debugging and troubleshooting

Iterative development practices

 Future Improvements

If continuing development, I would:

Implement a Room database for persistent storage

Add graphical progress visualization (charts)

Improve UI polish and accessibility

Implement cloud-based account storage
