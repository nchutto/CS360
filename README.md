##CS 360 – Mobile Application Development
Weight Tracker Android App

Nicole Hutto

##Overview

This repository contains my final project for CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming.

I developed a Weight Tracker Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to register, log in, and track weight entries with associated dates in a structured and user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a multi-screen Android application using modern development practices.

## Features

User Registration & Login

Secure password input

Add weight entries

Assign dates to entries

Delete entries dynamically

Real-time UI updates using Compose state

Navigation between multiple screens

Runtime permission handling (if required)

## Technologies

Kotlin

Jetpack Compose

Material3

Navigation Component

Android Studio

## Concepts Demonstrated

Multi-screen app architecture

State management (remember, mutableStateOf)

Navigation using NavController

LazyColumn dynamic lists

User input validation

Debugging with Logcat

Iterative development and testing

## Project Structure
MainActivity.kt
Navigation (Login, Register, Main Screens)
WeightEntry Data Class
Composable UI Screens
Permission Handling Logic

## Skills Gained

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:

Android application architecture

Kotlin programming

UI development with Compose

Debugging and troubleshooting

Incremental feature implementation

## Future Improvements

Persistent storage with Room database

Data visualization (charts/graphs)

Improved UI polish and accessibility

Backend/cloud integration
